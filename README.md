# PeopleFlow Tracker

## Overview
This project is a computer vision application designed to track and count people passing through two designated areas in real time. Using YOLO for object detection and OpenCV for video processing, it provides an efficient solution for monitoring foot traffic in various environments.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- YOLO (You Only Look Once)
- NumPy
- cvzone
- SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking)

## Features
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Tracks individuals in video feeds, identifying and counting them as they cross specified lines.
- **Customizable Areas**: Users can specify and adjust tracking areas using mouse clicks in the video feed.
- **Visual Feedback**: The application visually displays the number of individuals in each area and highlights their paths.
